FHE-encrypted loyalty points system on Zama FHEVM.

**Deployed Contract (Sepolia)**: [0x8a35B90e44c7ca33f8b3A374FcE9fD67793495EA](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8a35B90e44c7ca33f8b3A374FcE9fD67793495EA)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Contract
npm install && npm run compile

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

## How It Works

Imagine a casino rewards program where your gambling activity stays confidential:

1. **Casino** credits comp points based on your play
2. **Players** earn rewards privately - no one knows who the high rollers are
3. **Redeem or transfer** points without exposing your betting history
4. Only you and the casino see your balance - encrypted even during transactions
