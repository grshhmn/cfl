## How It Works

Imagine a casino rewards program where your gambling activity stays confidential:

1. **Casino** credits comp points based on your play
2. **Players** earn rewards privately - no one knows who the high rollers are
3. **Redeem or transfer** points without exposing your betting history
4. Only you and the casino see your balance - encrypted even during transactions
